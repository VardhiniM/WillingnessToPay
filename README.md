Analyzing the customer purchase behavior to understand the effect of coupons

Built a regression model to predict the change in unit price of ice cream with respect to the absolute change in purchase behaviors and household demographics. Based on the results, the household income and value of coupons are the decisive factors in the customer's choice. They are positively correlated with the relative price change, indicating that customers from households with higher income or with higher valued coupons buy higher priced ice creams.

On the other hand, the household size was negatively correlated emphasizing that bigger households save money by buying cheaper ice cream since they have to buy more quantity of it.
